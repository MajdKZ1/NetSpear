# Code-Free Contributions
You do NOT need to write code to help NetSpear grow. Here are high-impact ways to contribute:

## Submit Bug Reports & Feature Requests
When requesting a feature, include:
- What you want added  
- Why it helps NetSpear users  
- Optional: mock-ups of CLI menus or workflow steps  

When reporting a bug, include:
- Expected behavior  
- Observed behavior  
- Steps to reproduce  
- OS, Python version, NetSpear version  
- Stack traces or console logs (sanitize sensitive data)

**High-detail reports = faster fixes.**

---

## Help Users in Open Issues
You can:
- Reproduce bugs  
- Clarify discussions  
- Suggest potential fixes  
- Explain existing functionality  

This helps maintainers and keeps the project healthy.

---

## Test Pull Requests
You can:
- Pull and run PRs locally  
- Report whether features work  
- Confirm no regressions occur  

Even simple testing is extremely valuable.

---

## Report Security Vulnerabilities
If you find something that may compromise NetSpear itself, report it privately:

**OpenNET LLC — Cybersecurity Division**  
📧 OpenNETLLC@gmail.com
🌐 DM @MajdKZ1

We follow responsible disclosure protocols.

## Improve Documentation
Documentation always needs refinement:
- Improve clarity  
- Add module examples  
- Expand installation steps  
- Fix grammar or confusing language  
- Add visuals / CLI outputs  

Non-native English speakers are especially valuable for eliminating ambiguous wording.

---

# Code Contributions

## 1. Set Up Your Environment
- Fork the repository  
- Clone your fork  
- Create a virtual environment  
- Install dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
We recommend testing on Linux with Python 3.10+.
## 2. Good First Contributions

Easier contributions include:

- Adding recon modules  
- Improving Nmap output parsing  
- Adding error-handling  
- Extending the HTML/JSON reporting engine  
- Adding or refining CLI flags  
- Adding new payload generator profiles  
- Building small helper utilities  

These improve NetSpear dramatically without requiring deep exploitation knowledge.

# Expedited Module Creation Process  
*(Modeled after critical workflows of major security projects.)*

Sometimes multiple contributors submit modules for the same feature or vulnerability.

General rule:

- The **first contributor** who assigns themselves or submits a *good-faith PR* gets priority.

A “good-faith PR”:

- Does not need to be complete  
- Must show real work and functional direction  

If a module is **high-priority** (critical CVE, time-sensitive recon API, CISA KEV item, etc.), maintainers may:

- Ask a contributor to let a committer take over  
- Extend the PR while keeping original commits  
- Preserve full authorship credit  

Contributors will **always** be respected and acknowledged, even in expedited workflows.

# Vibecoding, AI, and LLM Assistance

NetSpear welcomes ALL coding styles — including AI-assisted work — **as long as:**

- Code works correctly  
- Code is fully tested  
- Code is documented  
- Code does NOT hallucinate nonexistent APIs  

We have seen AI-generated PRs that looked perfect but:

- Did nothing  
- Crashed instantly  
- Used imaginary functions  

**Untested code = incomplete code.**  
Incomplete code should be marked:

- **WIP** (Work in Progress), or  
- A **Draft PR**

We judge PRs by quality, not by how the code was written.
